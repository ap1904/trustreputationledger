## About Trust Reputation Ledger
- The underlying network for this application is the [Hyperledger Fabric](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/tree/master/docs), a Linux Foundation project.  You may want to review these instructions to understand a bit about the Hyperledger Fabric.
- **This is my approach to the chaincode app development with a Fabric network.**
- This is a `multiple assets` transfer demonstration. The aim of this project is to have a solid architecture to enable a trusted 2-way reputation management in a Multi Agent System that offer services to each other. The reputation is intended in 2 ways:
1. as a service executer and (aka: QoS)
2. as a service demander (aka: reviewer-reputation)

# Trust Reputation Ledger Setup

I developed this system thanks to this [IBM tutorial](https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain/marbles)
